				With the Covid-19 Global Outbreak showing little signs of slowing down, we have to embrace the inevitable reality that the Pandemic has and will continue to bring devastating impact to human lives across the world. Indeed, the scale and magnitude of the global impact of the pandemic are so great that the IMF has called it “The Great Lockdown: a crisis like no other”. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="para" id="2">
			<p>
				One particular chart, published by the World Bank, may be helpful to assist us in grasping the historical significance of the unprecedented global recession brought about by the pandemic. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="para" id="3">
			<p>
				The chart displays data on the percentage share of countries in the world experiencing recession each year going back from the 1800s.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="para" id="4">
			<p>
				The first thing that we can immediately observe is that the global economy is almost never completely calm; there are always some countries in some region experiencing recessions in any given year. In fact, the annual average percentage share of countries in recession throughout the years based on the data is equal to 30,2%. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="para" id="5">
			<p>
				The second important inference we can make is that the global economy since the late 20th centuries has been relatively calmer compared to the periods before World War II.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="para" id="6">
			<p>
				If we loosely define the event of “large scale international recession” as periods during which there are more than 50% of countries in the world (hence the majority of countries) that are experiencing recession each year, we can readily perceive that episodes of large scale international recessions are in fact very many throughout history; albeit more frequent in the past.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="para" id="7">
			<p>
				From the years of the 1800s until World War II, there were many occurrences of large scale recessions taking place globally. Two of these events were related to the great wars of the time: World War I from 1914 to 1918 and World War II from 1939 to 1945. Others were triggered by various aspects related to financial shocks and economic disruptions such as the Long Depression in the 1870s-1890s, the early 1990s recession, and including the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="para" id="8">
			<p>
				However, since the end of the 20th century, we have seen less of such large scale international recessions. While the global economy continues to have its ups and downs, including the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997/1998 these episodes tend to be concentrated in a smaller number of countries. The only large scale international recession we had was the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, prior to the year of 2020, we have been experiencing a much calmer global Economy in the last couples of decades. This has understandably led economists and decision makers around the globe to be more confident that we have in our arsenal the tools needed to maintain and restore stability should economic disturbances happen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That is perhaps why, what has happened to us globally this year is beyond anyone’s expectation and has caught almost all of us completely off guard. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="para" id="9">
			<p>
				The WorldBank forecasts that a whopping number of 92,9% of economies in the world will enter into recession in 2020, in line with IMF’s assessment that calls the Pandemic as “a crisis like no other”, and forecasts a deep contraction of the global economy by –4.9 percent in 2020. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That number is unprecedented and significantly higher than any previous events in history. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="para lastPara" id="10">
			<p>
				What we have this year is worse than the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis which was referred as the Great Recession: the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the Great Depression. The crisis, that was initially triggered by a turmoil in the US financial market, but then spread to a vast number of countries in the world, had brought damages to the global economy can still be felt more than a decade afterward.
			</p>
			<p>
				This coverage of effect of this year’s Pandemic is also bigger than all recessions that happened in the past, including the both World Wars, that also coincided with the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 that killed an estimated 40 million people, including the Great Depression in the 1930s. Comparison with the Great Depression in the 1930s is particularly worrying considering the scale of suffering it has brought to society, not only due to its magnitude, but also its length of duration which lasted for 10 years 1929 to 1939. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What makes matters worse is that the future trajectory of the global economy remains highly uncertain. The majority of economists, institutions and the world’s governments operate under the assumption that the economy will rebound in 2021. Yet this hypothesis is made based on a very shaky assumption that we will very soon regain control of this pandemic either through the discovery of vaccines, more effective medication, or that the society can return to function normally under new health and social protocol. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Explanations about the severity of the pandemic’s impact to the economy have indeed been offered. Most of the analysis has looked at the problem through the frame of reference of economic analysis; which argues that the combination of supply and demand shock, which is unique to the pandemic and lock-down policy responses, have exacerbated its effect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, another critical aspect that we should also take into account is that the recession this time is not caused by deficiencies in the social and economic system that we have authority over, but rather due to biological agents that may not necessarily be under the direct control of human civilization. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, we can and should appreciate the gravity of the situation that we as a global community is facing. This episode of the pandemic may signify how we have entered a new uncharted territory that will determine the shape of our shared future as human societies.
